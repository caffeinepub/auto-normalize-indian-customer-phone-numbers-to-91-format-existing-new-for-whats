  "summary": "The diff introduces multiple functional/frontend changes and a deployment checklist document, but it does not provide evidence of an actual deployment/build being produced or accessible via a preview/live URL. AMC tab wiring and authentication gating appear present, while ₹ currency consistency is only partially evidenced (utility added, but no proof of adoption across all UI).",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Deploy a new build of the current application state so the latest changes are live/previewable (new build produced and accessible via the platform preview/live URL).",
      "reason": "The diff only adds a checklist document and code changes; it does not include any deployment configuration, pipeline change, version bump, or other evidence that a new build was produced and made accessible at a standard preview/live URL.",

      "reason": "A new formatCurrency() helper using INR/₹ is added, but the diff summary does not show updates to the actual UI components (Dashboard overview cards, Revenue analytics, AMC views, dialogs) to ensure they all use it. Therefore, consistent ₹ usage across the UI is not verifiable from the provided changes.",
